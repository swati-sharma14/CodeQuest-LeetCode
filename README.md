# ðŸ§© LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions Repository! <br>
Here, you'll find a collection of solutions to LeetCode coding problems categorized by data structure and level of difficulty. ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

## Structure

The repository is organized into different branches based on the data structure involved and the level of the question (Easy / Medium / Hard). <br>
Each branch contains solutions to multiple LeetCode problems related to that specific category.

Explore the branches to find solutions for the following:

  - LINKED LIST (DOUBLY LINKED LIST) 

  - BINARY SEARCH 

  - BINARY TREES 

  - BINARY SEARCH TREES 

  - STACKS 

  - QUEUES 

  - BFS (BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH) 

  - DFS (DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH) 

  - DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 

  - ARRAYS 

  - TWO POINTERS 

  - MATRIX 

  - STRING 

  - HASH TABLE

  - MATH 

  - SORTING 

  - GREEDY 

  - MAPS 

  - PREFIX SUM 

  - COUNTING 

  - SLIDING WINDOW 

  - ORDERED SET 

  - GEOMETRY 

  - SUFFIX ARRAY 

  - HASH FUNCTION 

  - TOPOLOGICAL SORT 

  - DIVIDE AND CONQUER 

  - UNION FIND 

  - BACKTRACKING

  - MINIMUM SPANNING TREE 

  - SHORTEST PATH 

  - BIT MANIPULATION 

## Usage

1. Clone or download the specific branch containing the data structure and difficulty level you are interested in.
2. Explore the solutions to individual LeetCode problems within the branch.
3. Each solution will typically be stored in a separate file with a clear name indicating the problem's title or number.
4. Open the solution file and analyze the code implementation and algorithmic approach.
